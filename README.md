# Automated-Welding-Deep-Learning
In machine learning, data labeling is the process of identifying raw data (images, text files, videos) and adding one or more meaningful and informative labels to provide context so that a machine learning model can learn from it. Data labeling can be performed manually, automatically / semi-automatically. This project proposes a solution to semi-automatically classify and label large datasets. The project also goes ahead to design and develop an interface to operate our solutions.
